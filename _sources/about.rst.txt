About the work
==============

**Metamnesis** —'meta' (beyond) 'mnesis' (memory) — is a conceptual work of spatial music and audience participation touching on collective voice, memory, and space. The sound world consists of recorded voices by audience members that create an immersive storytelling experience. As an exploration of collective voice, metamnesis is the result of the interplay between audience and art, intimacy and the public sphere. As a spatial music work, metamnesis explores audio content analysis as a means for generative immersion. Metamnesis explores that which goes beyond memory, the ungraspable memory that resides in between the human and the non-human: in the difference of each memory and its delayed inscription, and in the immediacy and ethics of data access.
