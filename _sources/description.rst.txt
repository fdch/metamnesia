Recording
---------

In part one, individual audience members enter a recording room that reads and plays these words through headphones::

  How do you leave a trace
  the mark of your day
  a single day on a sign
  a wound, a sound
  a word in space?

  Trauma ? Denial ? Exclusion ? Survival ? Anger ? 
  Joy ? Love ? Hate ? Friendship ? Loneliness ? 
  Beautifulness ? Ugliness ? Homelesness ?

  Press the button to record. Press the button to stop.
  Your voice will become space.


Performance
-----------

In part two, audience members enter an auditorium with at least 16 independent channels and one sub-frequency channel (See :doc:`tech`). The audience is encouraged to move around the empty room. The room is dimly lit and emphasis is placed on the acousmatic movement of sound in space. The sound work is generative, ongoing, with neither beginning nor end. The sound can be described as a constant, ocean-like movement made of slowed-down and beautifully distorted samples. Most of the recorded voices are processed beyond recognition. However, the recorded voices are analyzed linguistically by an automated algorithm to find and separate some words. These words are then rearranged and mixed to build new stories creating unique traces across the room.
